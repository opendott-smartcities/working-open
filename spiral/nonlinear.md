### Nonlinear

WIP

Many entry points to this (is that a meta discussion?).

I remember reading about the book Rayuela by Julio Cortázar around the time I was experiencing the early commercial internet in Brazil, in mid 1990s. Even having access to a computer in Brazil was a privilege then.

#### Then and now - hardware and privilege

As I entered the University and possibly after I insisted a lot, my mum and stepfather took me to a big electronics fair in Porto Alegre. We settled for a 5x86 with 4Mb of RAM. It was a sort of reward for having gained entry to a public University after a pretty competitive (and starkly unfair) process called vestibular: a series of tests (eight or so) performed in a single week where 17 year olds need to prove they have memorised as much as possible of what they were taught during 3 years of high school. Naturally, most of those tests are in areas not at all related to what one wants to study. For instance, even if I was applying to study media and PR, I still had to perform well on chemistry and biology. Anyway, I have a good memory - and some luck - and got in. I'll keep my University years for another turn of the spiral. For now, suffice to say my family felt as though I had the right to have a computer at home.

Wait, there I go widening the narrative and inserting lots of personal stories that are not necessarily related to the point here. Or are they? You know what? This is nonlinear and infinitely editable. Right now (28.10.2020, anniversary of my dear Brazilian place Ubatuba) I'm standing in front of my workstation at home in Berlin - a laptop I don't particularly like for both technical and ethical reasons, added of an external screen and a bluetooth keyboard that is not great but still better than the one in the laptop. I shouldn't be complaining though, as it is a privilege to have a device that, I admit, works quite nicely. The distance between this particular device and the one my mum bought to me in 1996 is hard to even consider.

As I mentioned, that first PC I had was a 5x86 with 4Mb of RAM and a clock speed of 133Mhz. I have no idea what the hard drive size was. The computer was to be paid in monthly installments. If [this](https://cosmos.bluesoft.com.br/tabelas/tabela-de-salarios-minimos) is right (and I think it is), the Brazilian minimum wage by then was 100 reais. Now look at this: I had the immense privilege in such an unequal place as Brazil of being in a family that could afford to buy an equipment that cost a lot of money. I'm not sure of the figures, but if I'm not mistaken the price of that computer should be R$ 999 for those who could pay upfront. With our generous (for the banks, of course) interest rates, the total cost of buying in installments was considerably higher. I wouldn't be that off-mark if I said we were paying 12 installments of 120 reais. Hence, my first computer must have cost 1,440 reais - or the equivalent of 14 months of salary for a worker under full time employment.

This laptop I'm typing into right now is still very expensive in Brazil due to many factors: the great devaluation of the brazilian Real in the last year, import duties and the cost of intermediaries. Something around R$ 15,000 these days. The minimum wage in 2020 is something around 1,000. Which means someone working full time in unskilled jobs will likely never have access to this fast machine with a crappy keyboard. On the other hand, these days there are many affordable alternatives to have access to information processing equipment.





Are mobile phones the same?

My first PC was not fast. In fact, some weeks after the thing was delivered and finally installed, I got a coupon for a discount in the upgrade from Windows 3.11 to Windows 95, which all the newspapers were saying was the real thing. Yes, by then one would learn about tech from newspapers - the physical ones. Or tech magazines, which were expensive and sometimes came with floppy disks filled with freeware. I had been enamored of that world since years, but only had limited access to computers - a friend who owned a MSX where we would play Double Dragon, another one with a TK85. My dad's job, also. He was a punchcard operator in the 1980s, then became the head of the municipal technology department for some years. I attended extra-school tech classes, learning a bit of BASIC and COBOL. And yet, we had no computers at home - so not much space to practice. And there I was, aged 17 with a new computer which I would spend the nights exploring. And a box with loads of floppies to upgrade it to Windows 95. The process was not smooth, but I eventually finished. And the thing turned sluggish as hell.

### Cut - this whole document is a big brainstorm. This heading will disappear in future commits. That's a meta-reference

I'll just jot down my notes below and will in the future derive other documents from this one.

Before that though - I'm currently (2020-10-30) reading "Doughnut Economics". Just read there - the economy should not be visualized as a circle, but a system instead. Rings true to me.

Trying to think of an image or metaphor of building something from the ground up in a non-linear way. Some practice in which the foundations are later removed or transformed into something different. What I want is a parallel to these very text documents: groundwork that will likely disappear in almost its entirety whenever I start building up. As was the case when I started the Meta:Fora project with Hernani Dimantas. We had no idea what we were up to. The first step was setting up a mailing list on Yahoo Groups with a short statement (not long enough to become a manifesto). I'm paraphrasing: "what do we want when setting up a forum for people to talk became easier than deciding its name?". This was the origin, which we identified as a meta-discussion. Then jumped to name it along the idea of "metaphor", hence projeto meta:fora. Next we agreed on a list of 12 people we wanted to invite, and next day almost all of them were in. By then we were not yet attentive to gender or ethnic balance, and that took long to be intentfully corrected. Still, that mailing list paved the way to many things that happened later, which I don't feel like telling at the moment.

### More notes made upon taking the open leadership training by Mozilla

But first: I'm here discussing circularity and spirals, but I feel the open leadership training is an attempt to adapt the methods popular in startup culture to mission-driven or purpose-driven projects and organisations. The (main) problem is that start culture is inherently linear: you start with a (disruptive?) idea, lay it out, invite people, build up momentum and only then start getting circular (lean startup way). Even then, you're only building up critical mass to the magical moment of reaching startup nirvana (also called exit strategy, hopefully with an IPO that will turn the founders into magnates). That's hardly circular, and arguably unsustainable. Bootstrapping could be thought in other terms, I think (or hope). Changing the goal from coming up with radical solutions to engaging people who can enact systemic change. But now, back to my notes.

Openness <-> Abertura

Problemas com definicao

Remixing / Recontextualising

Open is not as generative as it used to be.

Co-oped and diluted. Big 5.

Openness as a tool to shift power.

Power is an important aspect.

Open society - how to interpret data? Evolving questions.

[Open science x common science](../science.md).

Active self-sabotage of leadership.

Normativity of the "project" format.

Ethics approval

Paying vs non-paying contributions.

Co-ownership (me: multistakeholder platcoops).

### After day 1

Antagonism analysis: what is the opposite of 'open'? 'Closed'?

 - Founding story of digital commons: enclosure of pasture ('commons'). Am I right to use the expression 'primitive accumulation' (add to reading list)? Modern sense of private property, in line with the development of capitalism. Forced extension of that to the idea of intellectual property when corporate broadcast media established its ties with political power. Then another attempt to extend intellectual property to the internet, conflicting with its non-adversarial nature.

What if we start from another path? (oops, I'm detouring from my notes, leave this line for later)

What if we think of open not in opposition to closed but to strictly planned? "Open-ended".

A friend and colleague in Brazil - an anthropologist - called my attention once to the way we were trying to push the digital culture programme in the context of Pontos de Cultura. He told me: "communities don't usually work with the idea of a project, with a clear beginning and expected end point". Nature is cyclic and so is life. Years later I found that echoing in the idea of 'lean startup', but as mentioned above I don't think it is a true similarity. Instead of working open-ended and in line with the cyclic nature of life, the lean startup disguises part of its development as a cycle only to capture as much feedback as possible into its construction and be able to leverage a power unbalance to generate extreme profit.

WEIRD - western, educated, industrialised, rich, democratic (plus: white, male). Democratic of sorts, that is. Incorporates the projectism perspective, the linear point of view.  

I was lucky...  stop. Part of acknowledging my own privilege is realising that making use of luck is not for everyone - seizing opportunities requires a level of comfort and reliability in one's own survival, which is a privilege indeed. In any case, I was lucky and privileged and made use of the opportunities I had to be part of a thriving moment in Brazil. I dedicated some years of my adult life to help develop what we then identified as Brazilian Digital Culture. We had the government on our side, for a while. In recent years however things turned back to how they were before (and more recently reverted full steam to levels below civilisation).

As resources to more experimental, open ended and common good oriented initiatives were meagering, I wanted to find alternatives to keep doing what I thought was important work for the communities I was engaged with. It seemed unfair that so many startups made money out of making rich people even richer (whilst destroying the bases of public services along the way), and I had to work for capitalistic enterprises to make ends meet and keep debt under control (which I did not, but let's leave it as that).

At some point I decided to read, watch and listen to everything I could about startups and canvasses and MVPs and prototypes and how to adapt them to sustainable and socially aware initiatives. And I tried to follow that way of doing things, trying to increase my level of tolerance in engaging with corporate responsability types and impact investors and other greenwashers. And I should say, I failed miserably at the exercise of coming up with an impactful idea, a disruptive concept, something that I should hold on to and insist and convince people that would change the world.

You see, I didn't want to change the world. Not all of it, at least. My objective was perhaps too modest. Only it wasn't. I wanted to find ways to allow all the socio-environmental innovators who were drawn to [Ubatuba](../ubatuba.md) to find ways to keep doing what they do without having to sell themselves to whoever paid for their time. I still believe that place could become an international reference in terms of socio-environmental innovation. But I found no way to channel resources into making that happen, and felt like a loser for that. That way of doing things - the 'lean' way - was just not my way. Which is itself lean, but in other sense. So, I failed. Not the first time. In every ten projects I have done, I'd say one was a clear success, about three or four are relative successes and the other half goes from minor fails to total waste of time. But here it was clear the inadequacy of the format to my way of doing.

I tend to start with relations, which may evolve to a community or not. What is a community to me, one may ask? It is a mix of commonality and difference. There's no community without commonality, of course. But there's no real community without difference. Difference is not the same as diversity, by the way.

Does it make sense in English to talk of "differences" as disagreements? I believe so.

I never understood one hundred percent of Simondon, but a Brazilian colleague has helped me see through parts of his work, years ago. In particular, it may be interesting to think of individuation, and what takes place before, how pre-individuated communities should establish their ties.

Connecting again to the text Jamie King contributed to the publication "In the Shade of the Commons" (which also has the excellent "A Letter to the Commons"). King's text is "On the plane of the para-constituted: towards a grammar of gang power". Instead of thinking of pre-constituted groups and post-constituted organisations, he discusses the idea of para-constituted networks that operate both as loose groups and established organisations.

Release early, release often. Re-reading The Cathedral and the Bazaar. Eric Raymond, white guy, WEIRD, blind to gender and ethnicity. Online discussions are blind to that. But not. Tone can be felt over text. Familiarity with language, all the same. We've been there - Meta:Fora and the early MetaReciclagem were based on text (mailing list, wiki) and took for granted that people knew how to use that powerful tool, written language.

The importance of being familiar with the language. When I was in Delhi, I asked how I could get to Nehru's place, what I imagined to be a similar place to Santa If in Sao Paulo. That was before google maps, smartphones and affordable GPS with public transport data. Someone told me: "you should not go there without a native to help you negotiate". I took their advice and gave up. Not being a local makes you feel impotent. The same applies to language.

Impotence is also part of the Letter to the Commons. What do you mean, you feel entitled to claim this creative work is "yours"? How about the centuries of intellectual accumulation you naturally build upon?

My way of doing is not about completing a predefined, linear, set of tasks. Rather, I reconfigure the whole thing at every step.

Open Science <-> Common Science. Lafuente -> Ubatuba.

Meta:Fora - tools easier than objectives.

 - Avoid jargon
 - Intentional self-sabotage of leadership
 - Combined leadership (no followers)

Mr. Robot vs. Rose:

 - I am a leader
 - Then where are your followers?

A game of disguise. Wear the hat. Pirate Flag (Hakim Bey, I believe).

Culture of Openness geared towards building commons.

 - Inclusion
 - diversity
 - Sustainabilityy
 - Interdisciplinary production

(are these mine?)

Culture of Openness from the onset. Reorganising the very processes of creation, production, releasing and circulating. Parallel to common science, again.

Cathedral and Bazaar: software starts itching a developer (wow this creative illuminist epic genius, once again bringing promethean light to the world). Great programmers know what to rewrite and reuse. All areas can have those people, not only coding. Seeing users as co-developers. How about the power balance there? Change the focus! Beta-testers. Myth of creative genius, a benevolent one only.

In the Shade of the Commons. Distinctions between producers / users; practitioners / audiences; writers / readers. Porosity.

Delhi Declaration for a new context for new media. Declarations, statements. I've been many times to events during which participants wanted to write a comprehensive and bold statement. I believe those are indeeed useful, but never have much patience to actually read them. Not relevant to me. I'm usually more interested in making acquaintances and getting them to help me understand better the whole thing we're all immersed in. Even by only opposing. I was once in a very high level conference that in general terms was about access to technology. A succcessful activist from an African country listened to me talking about MetaReciclagem and spent some time trying to convince me that we should incorporate, become an organisation. Only then, she said, would we be able to promote change and influence policy.

My take however was that we should not become an organisation precisely because we were already influencing government decision from the inside. There were public servants who were members of our open network, and a very interesting dynamics happened. As activists, some of us felt the very real power to influence discussions and decisions made by the government. On the other hand, those who were inside public institutions found a timely and fast aavenue to help themselves understand better the implications of government decisions, and generate ideas without the need to go the usual way - open a call, hire consultants, wait for months and finally get their hands on something that was outdated if not outright wrong.

A Letter to the Commons - CC never leavers the circuit od property, even when shared.

So much to translate and exchange from our experiences in Brazil.

Jamie King, on the plane of the paraconstituted. Gangs produce temporary biindings, ideas and motif. An array of purposes, identities and projects that produce singularities.

Gangs exist inevitably in every organisation. Disaggregation + reaggregation.

My own discomfort in the first international seminars I attended: watching white educated guys using their English language skills while I could only babble.

ANother path: Molecular Red.

References I used in the past. NEd Rossiter (+ Lovink), organised networks. Cibernetics and numerical control.

Maintainers burnout!

### Vision (?)

I AM WORKING WITH people, groups and organisations interested in transforming second-hand materials TO create structures for the collective stewardship oof physical goods TO citizens, nonprofits and businesses SO THAT they can prevent the generation of waste.

### Open Canvas

[Here](../open/canvas.md)

#### Problem

Materials that could be reused are currently discarded and end up incinerated, recycled ("downcycled") or in landfills (or worse).

#### Solution

System for the collective stewardship of materials.

#### Key Metrics

Higher proportion of reuse / waste.

#### UVP

 - Reward people and organisations that reuse Materials
 - Build a model of shared responsibility

#### ~~User~~ Stakeholder Profiles
